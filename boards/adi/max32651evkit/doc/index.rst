The MAX32651 evaluation kit (EV kit) provides a platform for evaluating the
capabilities of the MAX32651 ultra-low power memory-scalable microcontroller
designed specifically for high performance battery powered applications.

The Zephyr port is running on the MAX32651 MCU.

Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Signing the Firmware
*************************

Signing the firmware image feature is implemented to Zephyr for secure SoCs. This feature requires
`ADI Secure Boot Tools`_ to be installed on the host machine.

Signing the firmware image is done automatically in the background when you run the ``west build`` command.
User needs to set ``CONFIG_MAX32_SECURE_SOC_KEY_PATH`` to the private key's path. The signing process will
check the `ADI Secure Boot Tools`_ and use this private key to generate signed HEX and BIN files in the build
directory. The signed output files are automatically set as the default files for flashing, so the
``west flash`` command will use the signed images by default.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

Flashing
========
The MAX32651 MCU can be flashed by connecting an external debug probe to the
SWD port. SWD debug can be accessed through the Cortex 10-pin connector, J3.
Logic levels are fixed to VDDIO (1.8V).

Once the debug probe is connected to your host computer, then you can simply run the
``west flash`` command to write a firmware image into flash.

.. note::

   This board uses OpenOCD as the default debug interface. You can also use
   a Segger J-Link with Segger's native tooling by overriding the runner,
   appending ``--runner jlink`` to your ``west`` command(s). The J-Link should
   be connected to the standard 2*5 pin debug connector (J3) using an
   appropriate adapter board and cable

Debugging
=========
Please refer to the `Flashing`_ section and run the ``west debug`` command
instead of ``west flash``.
