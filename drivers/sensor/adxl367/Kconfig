	  Activity detection can be configured as referenced or absolute.
	  When using absolute activity detection, acceleration samples are
	  compared directly to a user set threshold to determine whether
	  motion is present. In many applications, it is advantageous for
	  activity detection to be based not on an absolute threshold,
	  but on a deviation from a reference point or orientation.
